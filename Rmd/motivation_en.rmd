__[Stick to Science](https://stick-to-science.eu) is the latest initiative calling for rapid re-association of Switzerland and the United Kingdom (UK) to Horizon Europe, the European Framework Programme for research and innovation.  Despite the undisputed strong engagement of the Swiss research community in the preceding programmes, statistics on participation are either outdated or limited.  On the one hand, [Swiss official figures](https://www.sbfi.admin.ch/sbfi/en/home/research-and-innovation/international-cooperation-r-and-i/eu-framework-programmes-for-research/f-f-swiss-participation.html) date back to January 2021. On the other hand, the EU has not yet published a final evaluation of Horizon 2020, its previous programme and EU's new statistics portal, [Horizon Dashboard](https://webgate.ec.europa.eu/dashboard), contains only limited statistics regarding country participation. As an alternative, the EU also provides public project funding data.  Unfortunately, these data suffer from quality issues and inconsistencies. Step-by-step instructions on how to collect and clean them have been documented [here](https://zambujo.github.io/swissparticipation/data-gathering.html).  On the basis of this work, we illustrate the participation of Switzerland in the previous Framework Programmes for research and innovation.__
