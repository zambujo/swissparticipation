__The [Stick to Science initiative](https://stick-to-science.eu) is the latest community call for a rapid association of Switzerland and the United Kingdom to Horizon Europe, the current European Framework Programme for research and innovation. Despite the strong engagement of the Swiss research community in previous European Framework Programmes, there is a lack of up-to-date figures from both Switzerland and the EU.  On the one hand, the latest official figures from Switzerland date back to more than one year ago. On the other hand, the EU has so far failed to publish a final in-depth evaluation report of the last Programme, Horizon 2020.  The EU does provide a new statistics portal, Horizon Dashboard, but country participation figures are limited and scattered across the different Framework Programmes. EU public data sets on the projects funded by the Framework Programmes provide a complementary approach to retriving custumized statistics and aggregations, but the data sets suffer from data quality issues and inconsistencies. Step-by-step instructions on how to collect and clean these data sets have been documented on a [separate webpage](https://zambujo.github.io/swissparticipation/data-gathering.html), before they can be used to calculate country participation statistics. This data story is an effort to combine multiple sources of EU public data to illustrate and update the Swiss participation in the Framework Programmes for research and innovation, specifically with regard to the participation of the Swiss research community.__
