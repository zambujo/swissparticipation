__[Stick to Science](https://stick-to-science.eu) is the latest initiative calling for rapid association of Switzerland and the United Kingdom (UK) to Horizon Europe, the European Framework Programme for research and innovation. Despite the strong engagement of the Swiss research community in the previous programmes, participation statistics are either outdated or limited.  On the one hand, [Swiss official figures](https://www.sbfi.admin.ch/sbfi/en/home/research-and-innovation/international-cooperation-r-and-i/eu-framework-programmes-for-research/f-f-swiss-participation.html) date back to January 2021. On the other hand, EU has not yet published a final evaluation of Horizon 2020, its previous programme.  EU's new statistics portal, [Horizon Dashboard](https://webgate.ec.europa.eu/dashboard), provides limited statistics on country participation. As an alternative, the EU provides public data on the projects funded by the Framework Programmes.  Unfortunately, these data suffer from quality issues and inconsistencies. Step-by-step instructions on how to collect and clean these data have been documented [here](https://zambujo.github.io/swissparticipation/data-gathering.html).  We then use them to calculate country participation statistics and illustrate the participation of Switzerland in the Framework Programmes for research and innovation, focusing on the participation of the Swiss research community.__
