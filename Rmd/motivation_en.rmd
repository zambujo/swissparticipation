__The innitiative [Stick to Science](https://stick-to-science.eu) calls for the rapid re-association of Switzerland and the United Kingdom (UK) to Horizon Europe, the European Framework Programme for research and innovation.  For Switzerland, this follows the discontinuation of the country's participation communicated by the EU in June 17 2021, a month after the launch of Horizon Europe in May 12 2021, and following the cessation of talks on the signing of the Swiss-EU institutional agreement in May 25 2021. Since 2004, thanks to a bilateral agreement with the EU on research and education, Switzerland's research community has been strongly engaged in the European Research Programmes up until Horizon 2020, which concluded in December 2020. However, statistics on participation are either hard to reproduce---[Swiss official figures](https://www.sbfi.admin.ch/sbfi/en/home/research-and-innovation/international-cooperation-r-and-i/eu-framework-programmes-for-research/f-f-swiss-participation.html) date back to January 2021 and their data sources are not always openly available---or limited---the EU has not yet published a final evaluation of Horizon 2020, its previous programme, and EU's new statistics portal, [Horizon Dashboard](https://webgate.ec.europa.eu/dashboard), contains only limited statistics regarding country participation. As an alternative, we aim to analyse Switzerland's participation in the previous Framework Programmes for research and innovation exclusively based on public project funding and participation data provided by the EU.__
