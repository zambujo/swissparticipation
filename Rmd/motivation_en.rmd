__[Stick to Science](https://stick-to-science.eu) is the latest initiative calling for rapid association of Switzerland and the United Kingdom (UK) to the ongoing European Framework Programme for research and innovation, Horizon Europe. Despite the strong engagement of the Swiss research community in the previous EU research programmes, there is a lack of insightful figures from both Switzerland and the EU.  On the one hand, the latest [Swiss official figures](https://www.sbfi.admin.ch/sbfi/en/home/research-and-innovation/international-cooperation-r-and-i/eu-framework-programmes-for-research/f-f-swiss-participation.html) date back to January 2021. On the other hand, the EU has so far failed to publish a final in-depth evaluation report of its previous research programme, Horizon 2020.  EU's new statistics portal, [Horizon Dashboard](https://webgate.ec.europa.eu/dashboard), provides country participation scattered figures across the different Framework Programmes. EU public data sets on the projects funded by the Framework Programmes provide a complementary approach to retrieving customized statistics and aggregations, but the data sets suffer from data quality issues and inconsistencies. Step-by-step instructions on how to collect and clean these data sets have been documented on a [separate webpage](https://zambujo.github.io/swissparticipation/data-gathering.html).  We then use these data to calculate country participation statistics and illustrate the participation of Switzerland in the Framework Programmes for research and innovation, and focus on the participation of the Swiss research community.__
