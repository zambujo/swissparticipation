Compared to Horizon 2020, Horizon Europe's budget suggests that the EU has divested from Pillar I on Excellent Science in both relative and absolute terms.  Furthermore, Switzerland and the UK have only had limited access to Horizon Europe as non-associated countries to date, given the stopped talks on June 2021 for Switzerland and the unclear path post-Brexit for the UK. If they remain largely excluded, Horizon Europe could be a step backward in enhancing the global competitiveness of European research.  Both countries have been key participants in Pillar I on Excellent Science and thus made an important contribution to the competitiveness of European research.  

For researchers affiliated with Swiss institutions, the exclusion from Horizon Europe entails either unfavourable conditions of participation (ex: no project coordination) or outright exclusion from funding instruments.  The exclusion particularly concerns the funding instruments in Pillar I, on Excellent Science, the most important pillar for Switzerland in previous programmes.

Excluding Switzerland from Horizon Europe prevents a win-win deal for research collaboration.  Combined with UK's exclusion, it could lead to a serious setback on the road to strengthening the European Research Area.

[Stick to Science](https://stick-to-science.eu) is as much about addressing the interests of Switzerland and the UK as it is about the defence of European research as a whole.
