Compared to Horizon 2020, Horizon Europe's budget shows that the EU appears to have divested from the pillar on Excellent Science in both relative and absolute terms.  Furthermore, Switzerland and the UK have only had limited access to Horizon Europe as non-associated countries to date, given the stopped talks on June 2021 for Switzerland and the unclear path post-Brexit for the UK. If they remain largely excluded, Horizon Europe may prove a step back from improving the global competitiveness of European research.  The two countries have been top participants in the pillar on Excellent Science and therefore important contributors to the competitiveness of European research.  

For researchers affiliated with Swiss institutions, the exclusion from Horizon Europe results in either unfavorable conditions of participation (eg. no project coordination) or unequivocal exclusion from funding instruments.  The exclusion particularly concerns the funding instruments in Pillar I, on Excellent Science, which has also been the most important pillar for Switzerland in the preceding Programmes.

The exclusion of Switzerland from Horizon Europe blocks a win-win agreement on research collaboration.  In combination with the exclusion of the UK, it may result in a serious setback to the path of strengthening the European Research Area.

[Stick to Science](https://stick-to-science.eu) concerns as much the interests of Switzerland and the UK as the defense of European research as a whole.
