Switzerland became fully associated with the Framework Programme in 2004.  Its status as an associated country has been challenged since the beginning of H2020.  Switzerland was initially excluded in 2014 due to the adoption of the popular initiative on "mass immigration". In 2015, it obtained a partial association status and, when the Immigration Law was revised in 2017, regained its full association status.

In 2021, its association status was again undermined by a setback in the negotiations on a new Swiss-EU institutional framework agreement.

A closer examination of EU contributions to Switzerland over the course of FP7 and H2020 reveals a temporary but sharp decline between 2014 and 2017. The timeframe coincides with the exclusion from and the partial association with H2020. 

The record level of Swiss participation in 2022 can be explained by the gap between the deadlines for the latest H2020 calls and the start dates of the projects.
