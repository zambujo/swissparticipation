Compared to FP7, Switzerland lost one position among the main participating countries in terms of H2020 EU contributions.  The delayed association with H2020 is the most probable reason for a 0.8 percentage points (p.p.) drop in the proportion of H2020 EU contributions, from 4.2% in FP7 to 3.4% in H2020. Conversely, Belgium moved up one position. The EU contributions to Belgium rose by 0.8 p.p, from 4.1% in FP7 to 4.9% in H2020.

Spain was the country which benefited the most with a 2.2 p.p. increase, from 7.2% in FP7 to 9.4% in H2020.
