Compared to FP7, Switzerland lost two positions among the top participating countries in terms of total EU contributions obtained in H2020.  Its delayed association to H2020 is the most likely reason for a 0.8 p.p. decrease in relative terms, from FP7 (4.2%) to H2020 (3.4%). By contrast, the total EU contributions to Belgium increased by 0.8 p.p, from 4.1% in FP7 to 4.9% in H2020.

Spain was the country that profited the most thanks to a 2.2 p.p. increase, from 7.2% in FP7 9.4% to in H2020.
