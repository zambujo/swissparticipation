Among the main participating countries in H2020, Switzerland, Israel, and the UK were the only countries that obtained more than half of EU contributions from Pillar I, on Excellence Science.

In addition, Switzerland and the UK were the only countries where institutions in research and higher education received more than three-quarters of the EU contributions.  In other words, Switzerland and the UK were the only countries in which less than a quarter of the EU contributions went to private for-profit companies.
