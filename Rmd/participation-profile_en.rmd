Among the main participating countries in H2020, Switzerland, Israel, and the UK were the only countries that obtained more than half of EU contributions from Pillar I, on Excellence Science. The size of Pillar I in all three countries underlines the commitment and contribution of their research communities to scientific excellence.

In addition, Switzerland and the UK were the only countries where institutions in research and higher education received more than three-quarters of the EU contributions.  In other words, Switzerland and the UK have the lowest share of EU contributions funding private for-profit companies.
