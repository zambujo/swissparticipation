Among the top participating countries, Switzerland, Israel and the United Kingdom were the only countries which obtained more than half of EU contributions from the pillar I on Excellence Science.  This illustrates both the strength and importance of scientific research in these three countries, as well as the engagement of their research communities in H2020. 

As expected, higher shares of contributions from the pillar on Excellent Science typically, but not necessarily, reflect higher shares of contributions to institutions in research and higher education. On this point, Switzerland and the United Kingdom were the only countries where over three-quarters of EU contributions were awarded to research and higher education institutions. This, again, illustrates both the strength and importance of research and higher education institutions in these two countries, as well as their involvement in H2020.
