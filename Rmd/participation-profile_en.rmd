Among the top 15 participating countries in H2020, Switzerland, Israel, and the UK were the only countries that obtained more than half of EU contributions from Pillar I, on Excellence Science. The size of Pillar I for these three countries underlines the commitment of their research communities to contributing to scientific excellence in H2020.

In addition, Switzerland and the UK were the only countries where institutions in research and higher education received over three-quarters of the EU contributions.  In other words, Switzerland and the UK were the only countries where less than one-quarter of the EU contributions were spent on private for-profit companies.
