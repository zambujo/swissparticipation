Among the top 15 participating countries in H2020, Switzerland, Israel and the United Kingdom were the only countries which obtained more than half of EU contributions from the pillar on Excellence Science.  This underlines both the strength and importance of scientific research in these three countries, as well as the engagement of their research communities in the Framework Programme. 

As expected, higher shares of contributions from the pillar on Excellent Science typically reflect higher shares of contributions to institutions in research and higher education, as opposed to contributions to private for profit companies. 

Switzerland and the UK were the only countries in which institutions in research and higher education also obtained over three-quarters of EU contributions. This, again, underlines both the strength and importance of the institutions in research and higher education in the two countries and their involvement in the Programme.
