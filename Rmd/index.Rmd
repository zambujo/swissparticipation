## Background

FP7 and Horizon 2020 (H2020) correspond to the part of the [EU Multiannual Financial Framework](https://op.europa.eu/en/publication-detail/-/publication/d2cf202e-f36a-45b2-84e7-1ac6ad996e90) (MFF) that is allocated to research and innovation. FP7 is an abbreviation for the 7th Framework Programme in Research and Innovation and corresponds to the MFF 2007-2013.  H2020, also known as FP8, refers to the 8th Framework Programme and corresponds to the phase of the MFF running from 2014 to 2020.  A new Framework Programme, Horizon Europe, started in 2021 and will conclude in 2027. 

Switzerland has been fully associated to the EU's Research Programmes since 2004 (see [Swiss Participation in European Research Framework Programmes](https://www.sbfi.admin.ch/sbfi/en/home/research-and-innovation/international-cooperation-r-and-i/eu-framework-programmes-for-research/f-f-swiss-participation.html)).  However, as a result of the adoption of the "mass immigration" initiative of the 9th of February 2014, Switzerland was excluded in 2014 and only partially associated in 2015 and 2016.  Despite regaining full association only in 2017, Switzerland kept its place among the top 10 beneficiaries in H2020 (TODO: add reference to figure).

A close look at the contributions to Switzerland by semester reveals a temporary decline between 2014 and 2017 due to the exclusion and partial association of Switzerland at the beginning of H2020 (TODO reference to the picture).

##  Structure of H2020 {.tabset .tabset-fade .tabset-pills}

The framework programmes are further organized in different sections. H2020, for instance, was divided in three main sections (aka pillars): (I) Excellent Science, (II) Industrial Leadership, and (III) Societal Challenges (see [link](https://ec.europa.eu/programmes/horizon2020/en/h2020-sections)).
