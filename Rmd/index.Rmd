## Background

Part of the [EU Multiannual Financial Framework](https://op.europa.eu/en/publication-detail/-/publication/d2cf202e-f36a-45b2-84e7-1ac6ad996e90) (MFF) is dedicated to research and innovation. This part of the budget is also   known as Framework Programme (FP). FP7 stands for the 7th Framework Programme in Research and Innovation and corresponds to the MFF 2007-2013.  FP8, also known as Horizon 2020 (H2020), refers to the 8th Framework Programme and corresponds to the MFF 2014-2020. The latest FP is the FP9, also known as Horizon Europe (HE), and corresponds to the MFF 2021-2027. 

Switzerland has been fully associated to the FPs since 2004 (see [Swiss Participation in European Research Framework Programmes](https://www.sbfi.admin.ch/sbfi/en/home/research-and-innovation/international-cooperation-r-and-i/eu-framework-programmes-for-research/f-f-swiss-participation.html)).  However, as a result of the adoption of the "mass immigration" initiative of the 9th of February 2014, Switzerland was excluded in 2014, at the start of H2020.  During 2015 and 2016 it became partially associated, until it regained full association in 2017 upon revision of its immigration law ([link](https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/new-immigration-law-clears-final-hurdle/42769316)).

## Swiss Participation Over Time {.tabset .tabset-fade .tabset-pills}

A closer look at the EU contributions to Switzerland by semester under FP7 and H2020 reveals a temporary but strong decline between 2014 and 2017.

## Top Participating Countries {.tabset .tabset-fade .tabset-pills}

Despite regaining the status of associated country only in 2017, Switzerland kept its place among the top participating countries in terms of contributions received in H2020. The initial exclusion and partial association resulted in a relative decrease of 0.8 p.p. from FP7 (4.2% of the total) to H2020 (3.4% of the total).

### FP7 (2007-2013)

```

##  Structure of H2020 {.tabset .tabset-fade .tabset-pills}

Each FP is organized in a few sections/pillars, each of which is subdivided in funding instruments. For instance, H2020 mainly consists of three pillars: (I) Excellent Science which gained 36% of the total budget, (II) Industrial Leadership 20%, and (III) Societal Challenges 39% (see [more](https://ec.europa.eu/programmes/horizon2020/en/h2020-sections)).

In Switzerland, the distribution of H2020 contributions was skewed towards the first pillar. Excellent Science accounted for nearly two thirds of the total contributions, whereas Industrial Leadership and Societal Challenges, combined, accounted for only one third. What is more, ERC grants, a funding instrument for which scientific excellence is specifically the sole selection criterion, alone corresponded to ca. 42% of the EU contributions to Switzerland.

### All countries

```

## Participation profile {.tabset .tabset-fade .tabset-pills}

Interestingly, among the top 10 participating countries, only the United Kingdom and Switzerland received more than half of the contributions from Excellence Science.

Not surprisingly, a higher share of the contributions from the first pillar is linked to a higher share of the contributions to institutions in research and higher education. Here again, the United Kingdom and Switzerland are the only two only countries, among the top 10 participating countries, where more than 3/4 of the total contributions was awarded to institutions in research and higher education.

> Conversely, mention the private sector.
