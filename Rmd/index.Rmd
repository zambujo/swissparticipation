## Background

Horizon 2020 (H2020) is the part of [EU's Multiannual Financial Framework for 2014–2020](https://op.europa.eu/en/publication-detail/-/publication/d2cf202e-f36a-45b2-84e7-1ac6ad996e90) (MFF 2014–2020) that is allocated to research and innovation. H2020 is also known as the 8th Framework Programme in Research and Innovation (FP8).  H2020 represents nearly 10% of the MFF 2014–2020 budget.

Switzerland has been fully associated to the EU's Research Programmes since 2004 (see [Swiss Participation in European Research Framework Programmes](https://www.sbfi.admin.ch/dam/sbfi/en/dokumente/webshop/2016/beteiligung_der_schweizandeneuropaeischenforschungsrahmenprogram.pdf.download.pdf/swiss_participationineuropeanresearchframeworkprogrammes.pdf)).
