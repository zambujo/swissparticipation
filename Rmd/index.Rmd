## Background

FP7 and Horizon 2020 (H2020) correspond to the part of the [EU Multiannual Financial Framework](https://op.europa.eu/en/publication-detail/-/publication/d2cf202e-f36a-45b2-84e7-1ac6ad996e90) (MFF) that is allocated to research and innovation. FP7 is an abbreviation for the 7th Framework Programme in Research and Innovation and corresponds to the MFF 2007-2013.  H2020, also known as FP8, refers to the 8th Framework Programme and corresponds to the MFF 2014–2020.

Switzerland has been fully associated to the EU's Research Programmes since 2004 (see [Swiss Participation in European Research Framework Programmes](https://www.sbfi.admin.ch/dam/sbfi/en/dokumente/webshop/2016/beteiligung_der_schweizandeneuropaeischenforschungsrahmenprogram.pdf.download.pdf/swiss_participationineuropeanresearchframeworkprogrammes.pdf)).
