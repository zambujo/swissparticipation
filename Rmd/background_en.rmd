Close to a tenth of the [Multi-annual Financial Framework](https://op.europa.eu/en/publication-detail/-/publication/d2cf202e-f36a-45b2-84e7-1ac6ad996e90) (MFF) of the European Union is spent on research and innovation. This section of the budget, also called the Framework Programme (FP) for research and innovation, is aimed at strengthening the European Research Area.

The programmes are run by the Directorate-General for Research and Innovation and by a number of Executive Agencies. FP7 refers to the Seventh Framework Programme and relates to the MFF 2007-2013.  FP8, called Horizon 2020 (H2020), refers to the Eighth Framework Programme and relates to the MFF 2014-2020. The current programme, FP9, is also referred to as Horizon Europe (HE) and relates to the MFF 2021-2027. 

Switzerland became fully associated to FP6 in 2004. Since 2014, coinciding with the beginning of Horizon 2020, its association status has been challenged.  The country was first excluded from H2020 as a result of the adoption of the "mass immigration" initiative on 9 February 2014. In 2015, it secured partial association and, upon revision of the immigration law in 2017, Switzerland regained full association.  In 2021, the association was once again compromised due to a setback of the negotiations on the Swiss-EU institutional framework agreement.
