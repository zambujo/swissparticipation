This section of the budget, also called the Framework Programme (FP) for research and innovation, is aimed at strengthening the European Research Area.

The programmes are run by the Directorate-General for Research and Innovation and by a number of Executive Agencies. FP7 refers to the Seventh Framework Programme and relates to the MFF 2007-2013.  FP8, called Horizon 2020 (H2020), refers to the Eighth Framework Programme and relates to the MFF 2014-2020. The current programme, FP9, is also referred to as Horizon Europe (HE) and relates to the MFF 2021-2027.
