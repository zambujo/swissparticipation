Close to a tenth of the [Multi-annual Financial Framework](https://op.europa.eu/en/publication-detail/-/publication/d2cf202e-f36a-45b2-84e7-1ac6ad996e90) (MFF) of the European Union is spent on research and innovation. This section of the budget, also called the Framework Programme (FP) for research and innovation, is aimed at strengthening the European Research Area.

The programmes are run by the Directorate-General for Research and Innovation and by a number of Executive Agencies. FP7 refers to the Seventh Framework Programme and relates to the MFF 2007-2013.  FP8, called Horizon 2020 (H2020), refers to the Eighth Framework Programme and relates to the MFF 2014-2020. The current programme, FP9, is also referred to as Horizon Europe (HE) and relates to the MFF 2021-2027. 

Switzerland became fully associated with the Framework Programme in 2004.  Its status as an associated country has been challenged since the beginning of H2020.  Switzerland was initially excluded in 2014 due to the adoption of the "mass immigration". In 2015, it obtained a partial association status and, when the Immigration Law was revised in 2017, regained its full association status.

In 2021, its association status was again undermined by a setback in the negotiations on a new Swiss-EU institutional framework agreement.
