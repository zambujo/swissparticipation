Almost one-tenth of the [EU Multiannual Financial Framework](https://op.europa.eu/en/publication-detail/-/publication/d2cf202e-f36a-45b2-84e7-1ac6ad996e90) (MFF) is dedicated to research and innovation. This part of the budget, also known as the Framework Programme (FP) for research and innovation, aims a strengthening the European Research Area.

The Programmes are implemented by the Directorate-General for Research and Innovation and by a few Executive Agencies. FP7 stands for the 7th Framework Programme and corresponds to the MFF 2007-2013.  FP8, known as Horizon 2020 (H2020), refers to the 8th Framework Programme and corresponds to the MFF 2014-2020. The ongoing FP, FP9, is also known as Horizon Europe (HE) and corresponds to the MFF 2021-2027. 

Switzerland became fully associated to FP6 in 2004. Since 2014, coinciding with the beginning of Horizon 2020, its association status has been challenged.

First, as a result of the adoption of the "mass immigration" initiative on February 9 2014, the country was excluded from H2020. In 2015, Switzerland secured partial association and, upon revision of the immigration law in 2017, regained full association.

In 2021, the association was once again compromised due to a setback of the negotiations on the Swiss-EU institutional framework agreement.
