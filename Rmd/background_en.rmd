## Background

Almost one-tenth of the [EU Multiannual Financial Framework](https://op.europa.eu/en/publication-detail/-/publication/d2cf202e-f36a-45b2-84e7-1ac6ad996e90) (MFF) is dedicated to research and innovation. This part of the budget, also known as the Framework Programme (FP) for research and innovation, aims a strengthening the European Research Area.  The Programmes are implemented by the Directorate-General for Research and Innovation and by a few Executive Agencies. FP7 stands for the 7th Framework Programme and corresponds to the MFF 2007-2013.  FP8, known as Horizon 2020 (H2020), refers to the 8th Framework Programme and corresponds to the MFF 2014-2020. The ongoing FP, FP9, is also known as Horizon Europe (HE) and corresponds to the MFF 2021-2027. 

Switzerland has been fully associated to the Framework Programmes since 2004, but the association status has been challenged multiple times in the more recent years. Following the adoption of the "mass immigration" initiative of February 9 2014, the country was promptly excluded from H2020. Switzerland regained partial association during 2015 and 2016 and, at last, full association in 2017, upon revision of the immigration law. Last year, the Swiss association has been once again compromised due to a setback of the negotiations on the Swiss-EU institutional framework agreement.
