Every Framework Programme is organized in pillars (or sections) which, in turn, are subdivided in funding instruments.  H2020, for instance, was composed of three main pillars: (I) Excellent Science, aiming at enhancing European scientific competitiveness globally, obtained 36% of the budget, (II) Industrial Leadership, aiming at maximizing competitiveness of European companies and SMEs, obtained 20% of the budget, and (III) Societal Challenges, aiming at tackling Europeâ€™s main political and social priorities, obtained 39% of the budged (see [more](https://ec.europa.eu/programmes/horizon2020/en/h2020-sections)).

In comparison to the overall budget distribution under H2020, the distribution EU contributions obtained by Switzerland was noticeably skewed towards Excellent Science.  In Switzerland, the first pillar alone accounted for nearly two-thirds of the total EU contributions. In contrast, the pillars on Industrial Leadership and Societal Challenges, combined, accounted for one-third only. Furthermore, contributions from the European Research Council (ERC), the flagship instrument of pillar on Excellent Science---the only funding instrument in which scientific excellence is the sole selection criterion---, corresponded to more than 40% of the EU contributions to Switzerland.
