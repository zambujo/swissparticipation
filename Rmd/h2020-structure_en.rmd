The Framework Programmes are divided into pillars/sections and further split into funding instruments/thematic priorities.  H2020, in particular, was composed of three main pillars:

  - Pillar I, on Excellent Science, aiming at enhancing European scientific competitiveness globally, obtained 36% of the budget;

  - Pillar II, on Industrial Leadership, aiming at maximizing the competitiveness of European companies and SMEs, obtained 20% of the budget;
  
  - Pillar III, on Societal Challenges, aiming at tackling Europeâ€™s main political and social priorities, obtained 39% of the budget.

As for Switzerland, the distribution of EU contributions obtained in H2020 looks remarkably skewed towards Pillar I, on Excellent Science, with a 64.3% share.

In addition, contributions from the European Research Council (ERC), the flagship instrument of the pillar on Excellent Science, accounted for more than 40% of all EU contributions to Switzerland. The ERC is the only funding instrument of the Framework Programme where scientific excellence is the sole selection criterion. Essentially, the relative share of ERC contributions to Switzerland surpassed that of Pillar I to all countries.
