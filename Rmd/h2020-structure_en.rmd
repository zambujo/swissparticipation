The Framework Programmes are divided in pillars (or sections) and subdivided in funding instruments.  H2020, for instance, was composed of three main pillars:

  1. Excellent Science, aiming at enhancing European scientific competitiveness globally, obtained 36% of the budget

  2. Industrial Leadership, aiming at maximizing competitiveness of European companies and SMEs, obtained 20% of the budget
  
  3. Societal Challenges, aiming at tackling Europeâ€™s main political and social priorities, obtained 39% of the budged (see [more](https://ec.europa.eu/programmes/horizon2020/en/h2020-sections)).

When comparing to the overall budget distribution for all countries, the distribution EU contributions obtained by Switzerland in H2020 was noticeably skewed towards the pillar on Excellent Science, which, alone, accounted for nearly two-thirds of the total EU contributions to the country.  For instance, contributions from the European Research Council (ERC), the flagship instrument of pillar on Excellent Science, in which scientific excellence is the sole selection criterion, accounted for more than 40% of all EU contributions to Switzerland.
